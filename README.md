How to Play:

The goal of this game is to move your player up to the water
without being hit by an enemy bug. Enemies move along the paved
roads and will force your player to reset his location to his
initial position if any player-enemy collisions occur.

The player moves only one grid block at a time -- left, right,
up, or down. He cannot move beyond the left, bottom, and right
boundaries of his world. In order to "win", the player must not
only arrive at the water's edge, but must move beyond that point
to reset to his starting position.

Enemy bugs will move on their own at variable speeds across the
roads. To move your player, use the arrow keys (left, right, up,
and down).
